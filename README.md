Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for modernized styling in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner can optionally prompt their own IDE's AI to start iterating on branding.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
